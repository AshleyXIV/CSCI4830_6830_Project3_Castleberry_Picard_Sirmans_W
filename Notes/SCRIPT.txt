Our virtual guide allows chef apprentices to practice their craft without the mess!
The interactive course features three levels with varying complexity,
including: Omelet(easy), Chicken Parm(medium), and Cake(challenging).
Users must combine the correct ingredients and monitor both cook times
and heat settings to pass each level. Additionally, chefs can compete
 with their competitors on the leaderboards to encourage better speed and accuracy:
 an important skill in the culinary world. Haptics such as control vibration and realistic
 sound effects help enhance the virtual experience for the chef, making them feel
 like they really are on the chopping block. Players will navigate with the
 walking and use the Oculus VR headset to look around. To interact with objects, the player can use
 the triggers to pick up or drop an object and the buttons to perform various tasks.
 This is the absolute best cooking simulation since Cooking Mama for the Nintendo DS
 Test your skills and see if you can please Steve! He'll be judging you with
 powerful scrutiny!
