--IDEA--~

To swap models we have a separate "island" that has all the stages ready
and when conditions were satisfied, the models would 'swap' locations immediately
to allow the player to continue cooking

SPECIFICS:
-Egg cracking
-Object location relativity



Thoughts on how to progress:

-We need to link all the objects together in sequential order for each kitchen
-We need to set triggers for the loops to update or "wake up"
-How to attach script to the controls and the objects
-Troubleshoot how to Troubleshoot

waypoint.transform.position = new Vector3(player.transform.x , player.transform.y + 20 , player.transform.z + 20);

so hold on, two public fields
theyre always going to the hand and theyre always goin to the pop drop lock one at the end. What it needs to do
it needs to hold an object and need to know when it has to swap for that object


Omelet models:
-Need to be attached to the containers that they're in for some reason
 The reason is: *cough* *cough* *cough* why aren't you writing this *confused look*
 *giggling/laughing* Hold on... *more laughing* Do you want a jelly bean?? *while laughing*
 Okay. The reason is: If we wanted to just change the object *deep thought* wait scratch that
 it would be like it would be hard I feel like it would be hard it's just so hard to thing when you're typing wha tI say
 It would be hard to attached multiple objects to the same bowl or frying pand, it would just be
 wasier to jhust have 2 frying pans, wait would it be though?? Because we're just swapping locations
 Because if the user usees the bowl we have to have some sort of location tag on the bowl??
 
 Alright lets continue... Okay, so here is an idea... we use the same bowl and just have a tag
 of the location in the center of the bowl! A script will then translate that egg mixture the new
 egg mixture to the location tag of the bowl and we just make sure they got the same radius!
 
 
>Matt has entered the chat
ok, so yeah the location tag in the bowl sounds like a good idea, but how should we go about implementing it? Have the center of
the bowl be the bowl object's 0,0,0 point, have some kind of attatched script that aligns it, or a child object of the bowl that 
the egg mix are then children of? Either sounds fine to me and about the same amount of hard to actually make so

we could also do the same thing with the frying pan, yeah? Seems like it -should- work, and I don't think it'd be too tough 
(famous last words) to add some sick food flipping pan action (optional, maybe save for 1.1 release or paid DLC).

I'll make some cracked eggs models and make them crack when they hit something - I may be able to find a way to animate the yolk 
falling from the cracked egg into the bowl then quickly swap the yolk model with the model for the basic egg mix, I *kinda* 
figured out how animations in unity work the other day when I added one to a model of the Night King that made him fortnite 
dance on the iron throne, so I think I  can figure egg stuff out if y'all would be into that, pouring milk too!

Here's a list of the models I'll make in the next day or two:
-cracked eggos
-separate models for:
 --diced tomatos
 --bacon bits
 --spinach
anything else I should add? Could make Steve dab on you if you burn the food ðŸ¤”
