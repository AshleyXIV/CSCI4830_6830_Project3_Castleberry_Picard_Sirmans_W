--IDEA--~

To swap models we have a separate "island" that has all the stages ready
and when conditions were satisfied, the models would 'swap' locations immediately
to allow the player to continue cooking

SPECIFICS:
-Egg cracking
-Object location relativity



Thoughts on how to progress:

-We need to link all the objects together in sequential order for each kitchen
-We need to set triggers for the loops to update or "wake up"
-How to attach script to the controls and the objects
-Troubleshoot how to Troubleshoot

waypoint.transform.position = new Vector3(player.transform.x , player.transform.y + 20 , player.transform.z + 20);

so hold on, two public fields
theyre always going to the hand and theyre always goin to the pop drop lock one at the end. What it needs to do
it needs to hold an object and need to know when it has to swap for that object


Omelet models:
-Need to be attached to the containers that they're in for some reason
 The reason is: *cough* *cough* *cough* why aren't you writing this *confused look*
 *giggling/laughing* Hold on... *more laughing* Do you want a jelly bean?? *while laughing*
 Okay. The reason is: If we wanted to just change the object *deep thought* wait scratch that
 it would be like it would be hard I feel like it would be hard it's just so hard to thing when you're typing wha tI say
 It would be hard to attached multiple objects to the same bowl or frying pand, it would just be
 wasier to jhust have 2 frying pans, wait would it be though?? Because we're just swapping locations
 Because if the user usees the bowl we have to have some sort of location tag on the bowl??
 
 Alright lets continue... Okay, so here is an idea... we use the same bowl and just have a tag
 of the location in the center of the bowl! A script will then translate that egg mixture the new
 egg mixture to the location tag of the bowl and we just make sure they got the same radius!
